Hi! My name is Cristian Meo, I'm final-year PhD student at [TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), supervised by [Justin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-dauwels-9146b62/?originalSubdomain=nl) Dauwels and [Geert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P9MqNggAAAAJ&hl=en) Leus, and mentored by [Anirudh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=krrh6OUAAAAJ&hl=en) Goyal.

Iâ€™m currently working on Generative Models for video prediction and model based RL downstream tasks. My current focus in on leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to learn Generalist World Models. 

Along my academic career I obtained a BSc in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino and a MSc in BioRobotics at TUDelft cum Laude. I have also spent six months as a research intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en) in Montreal, supervised by [Yoshua](https://yoshuabengio.org) Bengio and Anirudh Goyal.
