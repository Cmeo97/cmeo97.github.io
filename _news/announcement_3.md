Excited to share two incredible milestones from this year! Our paper "Masked Generative Priors Improve World Models Sequence Modelling Capabilities" received the **Outstanding Paper Award** at the World Models workshop at ICLR 2025. Additionally, our team secured a substantial **Snellius Compute Grant** of 31.9M GPU SBUs (~â‚¬400,000) on the national supercomputer to further advance our research in world models. Grateful for the amazing collaborators and looking forward to pushing the state-of-the-art even further!
