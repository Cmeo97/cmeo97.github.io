I am thrilled to announce that our paper, "Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting using Transformer-based Generative Models," has been published as a **SPOTLIGHT** paper at the ICLR 2024 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning! You can find the full announcement [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7174803950389346304/) and the preprint on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03929).
